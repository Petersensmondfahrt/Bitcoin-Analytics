# Bitcoin-Analytics
What drives Bitcoin's price? I analyze global M2 and calculate a regression between bitcoin price and global M2 using python
“Bitcoin as a Mirror of Global Liquidity and Risk Appetite“

# Who
The key stakeholders in this story are:
•	Investors — retail and institutional — who use Bitcoin as a speculative or hedging asset.
•	Financial analysts — interpreting how macroeconomic conditions (like money supply and yields) affect digital assets.
 
# What
My analysis explores how Bitcoin’s price movements relate to broader macroeconomic variables such as:
•	U.S. Treasury Yields (interest rate environment)
•	M2 Money Supply (liquidity)
•	S&P 500 Index (risk appetite in traditional markets)
•	Google Trends data (public attention and retail sentiment)
The objective: to show how Bitcoin behaves as both a liquidity-sensitive and sentiment-driven asset, reflecting the state of global risk markets.
 
# When
My dataset spans roughly 2012–2025, capturing three major Bitcoin market cycles:
1.	Early adoption phase (2012–2016) — low liquidity, high volatility, minimal correlation to other markets.
2.	Institutionalization phase (2017–2020) — correlations rising with traditional markets.
3.	Liquidity-driven expansion (2020–2025) — strong macro dependencies following COVID-19 monetary expansion and tightening.
 
# Where
This story unfolds globally:
•	The Google Trends map highlights countries with the strongest Bitcoin interest — from Nigeria to El Salvador to the U.S.
•	It shows that adoption and awareness are decentralized, often strongest in regions with inflationary pressure or limited access to traditional finance.
 
# Why
The main insights from your analysis show Bitcoin’s dual identity:
1.	Liquidity sensitivity:
o	The M2 Money Supply chart shows rapid expansion during 2020–2021, coinciding with a parabolic rise in Bitcoin prices.
o	As liquidity tightened, Bitcoin corrected — confirming its dependence on global money conditions.
2.	Risk correlation:
o	The BTC vs S&P 500 scatter plots and regression line show a positive correlation, particularly since 2020 — Bitcoin has become a risk-on asset.
3.	Market regime changes:
o	The K-means clustering plots reveal distinct volatility-return clusters — periods of extreme speculation, steady growth, and correction.
o	This segmentation highlights that Bitcoin’s market structure evolves with macro cycles.
4.	Yield environment link:
o	The 10-year Treasury Yield chart shows the inverse relationship between yields and Bitcoin’s price trends — when yields rise (tight policy), Bitcoin tends to struggle.
5.	Sentiment factor:
o	The Google Trends map connects spikes in Bitcoin’s popularity to bull market tops — showing how retail interest lags institutional flows but reinforces late-stage exuberance.
In short: Bitcoin reflects global liquidity, monetary policy, and investor psychology — not isolation.
